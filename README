This is code for creating planet ROS, an aggregation of ROS blogs.

It uses Planet Venus, a rewrite of Planet. More info at: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/


INSTALL

On Ubuntu, just install the package: planet-venus
Copy the current files in a folder.


USAGE

From the current folder, run:

rm -fr build; planet --verbose ros.ini

Everything will be built in the ``build`` folder. The index will be in ``./build/output/index.html``. You might need to change variables to
build and output to different folders: ``output_theme``, ``cache_directory``, ``output_dir`` and ``filter_directories``.

For the online version, it is located on wgs32 in ``/home/vrabaud`` and the script is run with the following cronjob:

16 * * * * planet /home/vrabaud/planetros/ros.ini


SECURITY

By default, all potential HTML threats are removed (iframe, javascript, embed ...).
The filter wg_desanitizer.py (in ./filters) creates some exceptions to that rule:
- if <object> contains a Youtube video, an iframe is created cotaining it
