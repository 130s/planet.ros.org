It uses Planet Venus, a rewrite of Planet. More info at: http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/


INSTALL

On Ubuntu, just install the package: planet-venus
Copy the current files in a folder.


USAGE

From the current folder, run:

rm -fr build; planet --verbose ros.ini

Everything will be built in the build folder. The index will be in ./build/output/index.html

For the online version, it is located on wgs32

SECURITY

By default, all potential HTML threats are removed (iframe, javascript, embed ...).
The filter wg_desanitizer.py (in ./filters) creates some exceptions to that rule:
- if <object> contains a Youtube video, an iframe is created cotaining it
